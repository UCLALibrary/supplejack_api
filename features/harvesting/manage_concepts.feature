Feature: Manage concepts

  # TODO: Implement this when searching story is up.
  # Scenario: Create a concept
  #   When I post a request to create a concept with the JSON:
  #   """
  #   {
  #     "concept": {
  #       "internal_identifier": "abc123",
  #       "label": "John Doe",
  #       "type": "people"
  #     }
  #   }
  #   """
  #   Then the concept with the identifier "abc123" should have attributes:
  #     | label | type   |
  #     | John Doe   | people |

  # Scenario: Update a concept
  #   Given a concept with the identifier "abc123"
  #   And a fragment with source id of "nz-census-2014" and the attributes:
  #     | name       | gender | priority |
  #     | John Smith | male   | 0        |
  #   When I post a request to update a concept with the JSON:
  #     """
  #     {
  #       "concept": {
  #         "internal_identifier": "abc123",
  #         "source_id": "nz-census-2014",
  #         "source_url": "http://nz-census-2014.govt.nz/",
  #         "name": "Bob Jones",
  #         "gender": "male"
  #       }
  #     }
  #     """
  #   Then the concept should have a fragment with the source id "nz-census-2014" and the attributes:
  #     | name      | gender | priority |
  #     | Bob Jones | male   | 0        |
  #   And the concept should have 1 fragment
