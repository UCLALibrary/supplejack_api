  # Scenario Outline: Find concepts by term and return JSON
  #   When I search concept for "<term>"
  #   Then the JSON at "search/results/0/name/0" should be "<name>"
  #   And the JSON at "search/results" should have <num results> entries
    
  #   Examples:
  #     | term    | name           | num results |
  #     | mccahon | Colin McCahon  | 1           |
  #     | rita    | Rita Angus     | 1           |
  #     | david   | David Hill     | 2           |
  #     | muldoon | Robert Muldoon | 1           |

  # Scenario: Search all concepts
  #   When I visit index page for the concepts
  #   Then the JSON at "search/result_count" should be 5
  #   And the JSON at "search/results" should be an array
  #   And the JSON at "search/per_page" should be 20
  #   And the JSON at "search/page" should be 1
  #   And the JSON at "search/request_url" should be the requested url

  # Scenario: Search for a concept
  #   When I search concept for "Muldoon"
  #   Then the JSON at "search/results" should be an array
  #   And the JSON at "search/facets" should be an hash
  #   And the JSON at "search/result_count" should be 1
  #   And the JSON at "search/per_page" should be 20
  #   And the JSON at "search/page" should be 1
  #   And the JSON at "search/request_url" should be the requested url

  # Scenario: Search for a concept using the OR operator
  #   When I search concept for "Rita OR Robert"
  #   Then the JSON at "search/result_count" should be 2
  #   And the JSON at "search/results/0/name/0" should be "Rita Angus"
  #   And the JSON at "search/results/1/name/0" should be "Robert Muldoon"

  # Scenario: Search for a concept using the NOT operator
  #   When I search concept for "david NOT hill"
  #   Then the JSON at "search/result_count" should be 1
  #   And the JSON at "search/results/0/name/0" should be "David Lange"

  # Scenario: Should not search concept for the term in other fields
  #   When I search concept for a field "hasMet_sm:\"Obama\""
  #   Then the JSON at "search/result_count" should be 0

  # Scenario: Return facets in JSON format
  #   When I search concept for "David" with facet "name"
  #   Then the JSON at "search/facets" should be:
  #   """
  #     {
  #       "name": {
  #         "David Hill": 1,
  #         "David Lange": 1
  #       }
  #     }
  #   """

  # Scenario: Search for a concept from a valid field
  #   When I search concept for "politician" within "description" field
  #   Then the JSON at "search/result_count" should be 1
  #   And the JSON at "search/results/0/name/0" should be "David Lange"

  # Scenario: Search for a concept from an invalid field
  #   When I search concept for "politician" within "name" field
  #   Then the JSON at "search/result_count" should be 0

  # Scenario: Sort search results in ascending order
  #   When I search concept with sort by "dateOfBirth" in "asc" order
  #   Then the JSON at "search/results" should be an array
  #   And the JSON at "search/result_count" should be 5
  #   And the JSON at "search/results/0/name/0" should be "Colin McCahon"
  #   And the JSON at "search/results/1/name/0" should be "Rita Angus"

  # Scenario: Sort search results in descending order
  #   When I search concept with sort by "dateOfBirth" in "desc" order
  #   Then the JSON at "search/results" should be an array
  #   And the JSON at "search/result_count" should be 5
  #   And the JSON at "search/results/0/name/0" should be "Robert Muldoon"
  #   And the JSON at "search/results/1/name/0" should be "David Lange"

  # Scenario: Display specific field
  #   When I search concept for "politician" with "name,description" fields
  #   Then the JSON at "search/results" should be an array

  #   And the JSON at "search/results/0/name/0" should be "David Lange"
  #   And the JSON at "search/results/0/description" should be "David Lange is a politician"
